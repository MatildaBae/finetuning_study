# Finetuning Study üõ†Ô∏è

## What‚Äôs this about?
- Learning to fine-tune language models (like Llama, Transformer) for custom NLP tasks.
- Basically, taking pre-trained models and making them awesome for specific stuff.

## What will we do?
- Prep data that fits the task (e.g., sentiment analysis, summarization).
- Experiment with fine-tuning techniques like transfer learning & few-shot learning.
- Use tools like Hugging Face and PyTorch to optimize models.
